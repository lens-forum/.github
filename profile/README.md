# 🌿 LensForum

**LensForum** is a decentralized community hub designed for open discussions, questions, and collaboration within the **Lens Protocol** ecosystem.

## 🔍 What is LensForum?

LensForum is where the Lens community comes to talk.

From protocol questions to ecosystem proposals, LensForum creates a dedicated space for thoughtful, persistent, and community-driven conversation — all onchain and censorship-resistant.

It serves as a social layer for builders, creators, and users in Lens who want more than just fleeting content: they want real threads, deeper insights, and shared knowledge.

## 💡 Why it matters

While Lens Protocol powers social presence and publishing, it lacks a space for:

- 🧵 Structured, long-form discussions  
- 🤝 Community support and knowledge sharing  
- 🗳️ Idea proposals and feedback loops  

**LensForum** fills that gap by offering a space designed for slower, richer conversation — aligned with the values of decentralization and open collaboration.
